don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer
better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
give a man a fish and you will feed him for a day
the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing
a place for everything and everything in its place
